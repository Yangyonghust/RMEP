# RMEP
MEP model by R
Implementing maximum entropy production model by R. Accurate estimate of energy budget and evapotranspiration are significant in global ecosystem and climate.This package, based on the maximum entropy production(MEP) model, providing functions for calculating latent heat flux, sensible heat flux,ground heat flux as well as evapotranspiration (including actual ET and potential ET), which can be applied in the fields of hydrology, meteorology and geophysics.
